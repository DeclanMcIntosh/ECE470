# ECE470 Project Code

This project utalizes ResUnet++ and LeGall Cuda preprocessing to perform semantic segmentation of polyps from white light colonoscopy images. 

## Instructions

1. Data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aMCd0dbnwLtL3aKZeUHX6JdL5B-yVxbB/view?usp=sharing or from project submission.

2. The dowloanded data can be placed in the main directory and unziped.

3. The trained model and logs can then be extracted in the root directory of the project.

4. Next install Python Version 3.6.6 (This is the only version this code has been implemented for or tested on).

5. Once Python has been installed used PIP to install all dependencies in "dependencies.txt".

6. To demo the program the run "demo.py" this will show you a series of example outputs from the model and the associated RGB inputs and the expected ground truth. All examples are from the test set data.
